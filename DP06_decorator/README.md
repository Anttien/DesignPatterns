An implementation of the Decorator design pattern.

It creates a simple file writer that writes/reads a string to a file and that is wrapped in cipher decorator that encrypts/decrypts the written/read string with Caesar cipher. The Caesar cihper is a technique that replaces letters of a text by a letter some fixed number of positions down/up the alphabet.

The ciphered text is written to [important.info](important.info).
