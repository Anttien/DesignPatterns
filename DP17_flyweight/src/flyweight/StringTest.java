/**
 * Tests when Java String objects are flyweight objects. Strings that are
 * specified at compile-time and that contain the same character sequence are
 * flyweights in Java. ThatÂ´s why the strings `fly` and `fly2` refer to the same
 * String instance. On the other hand, if String objects are concatenated, it is
 * done during runtime and the products of this are not flyweights by default.
 * This can be avoided with the method String.intern(), which returns flyweights
 * for strings computed at runtime.
