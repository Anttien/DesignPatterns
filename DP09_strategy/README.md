Strategy pattern makes it convenient to change object behaviour dynamically. This program compares different sorting algorithm run times by changing the sorting algorithm dynamically via a Strategy design pattern and outputs the results to console. The current algorithms are merge sort, selection sort and quick sort.

An example output:

    Sorting done (merge sort)! Took: 0.25 seconds.
    Sorting done (selection sort)! Took: 220.62 seconds.
    Sorting done (quick sort)! Took: 0.01 seconds.
